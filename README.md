# SteamScreenshotDownloader

I wanted to download all of my screenshots from Steam but I couldn't find any good way. This works but it'll only download screenshots that are public. So you need to make your profile and screenshots public to grab them all.

It works by RegEx'ing Steam's website so it'll need fixing up if they change the design much.
